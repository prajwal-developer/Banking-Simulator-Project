# Banking-Simulator-Project
This is a console-based Java application that simulates basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check account balance, transfer funds, and view transaction history with PIN-based authentication for security. It uses ArrayList to manage multiple accounts and follows a menu-driven approach, making it simple, secure, and similar to real-world ATM/banking systems.
